# A-simple-word-encryption-program
This is a simple word encryption program.
It simply finds all the vowels in a sentence (A,E,I,O,U), then replaces them with number 1,2,3,4,5 respectively.
Then if it finds a letter thats not a vowel, it prints the letter with an 'a' after it
This encryption used to be what my cliche chatted with when I was younger. I just thought to convert it tp a program
